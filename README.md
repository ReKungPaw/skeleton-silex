# Silex Skeleton

I try to learn some new things in my free time, one of them is PHP and SILEX. 

Now i try to build a skeleton for me with basic stuff. I hope that some people can give me some hints for my code and i learn more and more.

You can easily setup this project:
1. Clone git repository or download this repository
2. Setup a database
3. Add your database config into /app/config/dev.php or /app/config/prod.php
4. Create table 'user' a dummy table structure is given in /database/user.sql
5. composer install for installing the third party packages
